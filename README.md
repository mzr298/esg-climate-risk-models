# ESG & Climate Risk Models in Python

Building Python expertise for ESG analysis and climate risk assessment—from fundamentals to advanced modeling.

## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in Python, specifically applied to:
- **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Accounting** - Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions
- **Climate Risk Assessment** - TCFD framework alignment
- **ESG Metrics** - Scoring and analysis
- **Financial Modeling** - Climate-adjusted valuations

**Target Skills:** ESG Analyst | Project Finance | Climate Risk Modeling | Python for Finance

## 🎯 Projects
